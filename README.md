# Calculator-tkinter
Calculator using tkinter library in python

This is my first python project. I had an interest in GUIs, so as soon as I learnt the basics of tkinter I started working on this project.

<h2>Making the layout of the calculator</h2>
In this calculator, a frame is used for making the screen, and two labels, one for putting digit buttons and the other for function keys are used. I used sub-labels inside these labels to put buttons on it.
<h2>Making an entry screen</h2>
Entry box is used for making the screen of the calculator.
<h2>Making buttons </h2>
Till this stage my claculator was completed, virtually, it was not functionable. I binded buttons to the functions and results are printed on the calculator's screen.
<h2>Giving it a classic look</h2>
I gave it nice color combinations to make it classic as it is!
